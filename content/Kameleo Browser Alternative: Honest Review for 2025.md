## How Kameleo Works: A Unique Approach

Kameleo differs from traditional antidetect browsers by focusing on **local profiles** instead of **cloud-based profiles**. It allows users to set unique fingerprints for browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. However, it lacks the convenience of cloud syncing, which can be a significant drawback for users seeking mobility and ease of access.

### Key Features:
- **Local Profiles**: All browser profiles are stored locally on your device, limiting portability.
- **Supported Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- **Technical Setup**: Users must manually select fingerprints and configure browser cores, making it less beginner-friendly.

---

## OS & Mobile Support

### Mobile App:
Kameleo offers an Android app for protected mobile browsing, but it’s only available with the **Advanced plan** (€89/month, €113 with VAT). The mobile app must be used alongside the desktop app, limiting its utility for users who prefer standalone mobile solutions.

### OS Support:
- **Windows Only**: Kameleo does not support macOS, excluding a significant portion of users who rely on Apple devices.

---

## Usability & User Experience

Kameleo is designed for **tech-savvy users** who are familiar with browser fingerprinting and manual configurations. Key aspects of usability include:

- **Outdated Interface**: While functional, the design feels clunky compared to modern antidetect browsers.
- **Manual Fingerprint Selection**: Users must manually choose fingerprints from a database, which can be overwhelming for beginners.
- **Proxy Configuration**: Proxy credentials must be entered manually, adding to the workload.

> **Note**: These limitations make Kameleo less suitable for beginners or businesses prioritizing ease of use.

---

## Support & Updates

- **Customer Support**: Kameleo’s support has a reputation for being slow, as noted in various user reviews. While recent Trustpilot reviews suggest some improvement, the lack of live chat is a disadvantage.
- **Browser Updates**: Kameleo’s update schedule is slower compared to competitors. For instance, its Chromium-based browser was released only recently, lagging behind more established antidetect solutions.
