## Introduction to Multilogin: First Impressions

Multilogin advertises itself as an antidetect browser for web scraping and multi-account management. However, these terms can be vague for new users. For experienced marketers, Multilogin X introduces a shift from its desktop browser app to a web-based interface—a transition that has both pros and cons. 

### Registering for Multilogin X

- Multilogin X requires new users to sign up via their web app.
- A **desktop agent download** is still necessary to run browser profiles, meaning Multilogin's "web app" is more of a control panel than a standalone solution.

While registration is simple, some users may find the shift from desktop to web painful, especially those accustomed to traditional apps.

## Performance Review: Multilogin in 2025

### Usability and Features

At a glance, the Multilogin interface feels minimalistic but lacks flexibility. Here are the main points we observed:

- **Proxy Management**: Users must manually paste proxy credentials for each profile, a tedious task for those managing multiple accounts. There's no built-in proxy manager or visible proxy column in the profile table.
- **Profile Customization**: While some settings are adjustable, advanced options like custom screen resolution or CPU/RAM configurations are unavailable.
- **Limited Functionality**: The main profile table is non-customizable. Critical features like cookie management require third-party tools.

Verdict: Multilogin lacks essential features expected in 2025, making it feel outdated.

### Mobile and Remote Work

In 2025, mobile compatibility is key for remote workers, yet **Multilogin offers no mobile apps or mobile fingerprinting**. By comparison, other tools like GoLogin provide full mobile support and compatibility with devices beyond laptops.

Verdict: Multilogin’s lack of mobile support is a significant drawback.

---

### Support and Updates

Multilogin offers reliable customer support and frequent updates, though it does not cater to advanced technical users. 

**Key Points**:
- Updates are automatic but limited to default browser cores.
- Technical support is responsive but lacks solutions for deeper technical problems.

Verdict: Multilogin provides decent support and update frequency but misses features for advanced users.
